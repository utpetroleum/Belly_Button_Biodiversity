# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to display a completed panel for demographic information and visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer in the Improbable Beef experiment. Bacteria in participants' belly button were retrieved. The volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
